			<i><b>Which Sports Executives Are the Most Politically Active?</b></i>
        </h1>
				   
        <h3>

        <p>
          It’s no secret that many of the nation’s sports owners and executives are multi-billionaires with plenty of capital to spend. Some owners like Hal Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, spend lots of their money directly on improving the team. Some, like Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, look to improve the team, but additionally spend on luxurious items such as yachts, mansions, and marvelous stadiums.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many, as has been well-documented by multiple people previously, act as pseudo-lobbyists. Often, sports-owners have the communities in which they reside by the horns — threatening to leave and relocate elsewhere if they don’t receive funding for new stadiums.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was evident recently, when Terry Pegula and his wife Kim, owners of the Buffalo Bills, reportedly sought cities of relocation as they looked to secure local and New York State funding to build their new stadium, replacing the current Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park. A deal was eventually made keeping them in their current Western New York suburb — with a record $850 million in taxpayer funding going towards the new stadium.
        </p>

        <p>
          America has entered a new age, however. Citizens are now more socially active, and the internet has made it easier for those interested to view the financial activity of the rich and powerful. Owners have made lots of donations in recent years to political campaigns, and some say the reasons why are multifaceted.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          We analyzed a set of donations from FiveThirtyEight detailing donations from sports owners in 2016 — the year former President Donald Trump was elected, 2018 — when Democrats took over the House, and 2020 — when current president Joe Biden was elected. Within these three election years, American sports owners and executives donated nearly $47 million to political campaigns.
        </p>

        <p>
          The highest total amount of money donated was by Charles Johnson, principal owner of Major League Baseball’s San Francisco Giants. Johnson donated over $11 million during the four-year period that the donation data was tracked, making 213 individual donations.
        </p>

        <p>
          By league, every different league has a different donation leader on top.
        </p>
		  
		<h2>
			<b>WNBA</b>
		</h2>

        <p>
          Kelly Loeffler, former Georgia Senator and former part-owner of the Atlanta Dream led the WNBA in donation amount. Loefller made about $896,000 in donations over the course of the four year period — every single one of her donations going towards Republican or conserative causes. Following her is John Rogers, owner of the Chicago Sky, who donated about $694,000 and Herbert Simon, who donated about $525,000. Simon owns the WNBA’s Indiana Fever, in addition to the NBA’s Indiana Pacers.

        <h2>
			<b>WHY DO OWNERS MAKE THE DONATIONS THEY DO?</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Professor Rick Burton, an endowed professor of sport management at Syracuse University’s Falk College, says political donations can be used as a “defensive maneuver.” Burton believes public pressure is key to some of these donations, and that the owners, and those who work for them, are watching the social activity of their clientele.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          “By showing that I’m in support of a particular cause, I don’t have a blindside,” Burton said. “I can’t be accused of not being supportive. What we really don’t know is whether or not that owner is all in, whether that owner is sincere and walks the walk.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Arthur Paris, a longtime professor of sociology at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Public Affairs, says owners have no problem donating until their activities may come under the spotlight, essentially saying that it’s no problem until it hurts an owner’s bottom line. Paris not only talks about this from a political perspective, but in terms of many day-to-day business issues as well, such as the issue of head trauma and concussions in the NFL.
        </p>

        <p>
          “As you get closer to a fundamental challenge to their central activity, then I think their resolve hardens,” Paris said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Burton mentioned that a genuine “passion for the cause” could be behind a specific donation, but there are some business reasons, such as tax breaks and stadium deals.
        </p>

        <p>
          “If the owner knows that [a cause is] important to a sponsor, that that’s the kind of thing that might cause a sponsor to become a sponsor of the team or to renew a sponsorship,” he said. “It could be because [a cause is] important to an owner’s players…”
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of donating to a specific party, Burton says the rhyme and reason is actually quite simple. It’s about influence, and what an owner can get in return for a check.
        </p>

        <p>
          “[It can be] for the very political reasons of 'Who controls that state’s legislature?'" Burton said. “Who controls big decisions that are going to be made relative to an owner wanting to develop a piece of land — and whether or not that endorsement of a political party or a political individual is going to facilitate their long-term goals?”
        </p>
